###Variables###

#Any line that starts with a # is a comment and will be ignored when the program runs.

#Prints 10
print(5 + 5)

#Prints the string "Hello World!"
print("Hello World!") 

#Doing the same thing with variables
i = 10
print(i)

s = "Hello World!"
print(s)

#changing the values of variables

i = 15
s = i

print(i)
print(s)

#variables can also store truth, or boolean, values

b = True
not_b = False

print(b)
print(not_b)

#Try making some of your own variables and printing them
