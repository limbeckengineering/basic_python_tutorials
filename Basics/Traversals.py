#For loops do something for every element in a range

#prints the numbers 0 through 9
for i in range(0, 10):
	print(i)

#you can also use a list to do this

l = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
for i in l:
	print(i)

#with a list of strings
s = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
for j in s:
	print(j)

#Try writing your own for loop
